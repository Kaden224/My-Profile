<p>I am Kaden, and I am 10 years old. I make animations and games through Scratch! I may be a coder, but I have other hobbies! I like to do golf and soccer, but I usually code. WhiteHatJr showed me this Brackets, so I give a thanks to them, or this project you are seeing would not exist! I also want to thank Scratch Jr, and Scratch for helping me get more experienced with code! I have now learned to code and I want to become better and better! So I can then make my own google play game people actually can see! </p>
